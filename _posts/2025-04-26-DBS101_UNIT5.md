### Features of Good Relational Design
#### Relation for Every Entity
* Each table represents a single entity or relationship.
* No mixing of unrelated attributes.
* Use foreign keys for references, and keep entity and relationship attributes separate.

#### Fewer Null Values
* Design tables to minimize nulls.
* Frequently null attributes can be moved to separate tables with primary keys.

#### No Spurious Tuples (Lossless Decomposition)
* Avoid incorrect results from JOINs.
* Use lossless join property to maintain data integrity during decomposition.
* Ensure decompositions do not introduce spurious data.

#### No Redundancy
* Avoid repeating data across tables to save space and avoid anomalies.
* Redundancy leads to:
Extra storage,
Repeated insertions/deletions,
Update anomalies

#### No Modification Anomaly
* Update Anomaly: Changes in one place must be done in multiple places.
* Deletion Anomaly: Removing one record may lead to unintended loss of related data.
* Insertion Anomaly: Cannot add data unless other unnecessary data is available.

### Decomposition
* Splitting a table into multiple smaller ones to eliminate repetition.

* Must be lossless and ideally dependency-preserving.

* Bad decomposition (lossy) leads to data loss.

### Functional Dependency (FD)
* A relationship between two sets of attributes.

* If X → Y, then knowing X lets you determine Y.

* Types of FDs: Full, partial, transitive, trivial, etc.

### Closure of Functional Dependencies (F⁺)
The complete set of dependencies logically implied by a given FD set F.

* Use Armstrong’s Axioms to derive them:

* Reflexivity: If Y ⊆ X, then X → Y.

* Augmentation: If X → Y, then XZ → YZ.

* Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z, then X → Z.

### Canonical Cover
* A simplified version of F that:

* Contains no redundant dependencies.

* Retains the same meaning (i.e., same closure).

* Has unique LHS in every FD.

* No extraneous attributes.

### Dependency Preservation
* Ensures all original FDs still apply after decomposition.

* Important for database consistency and integrity.

* Sometimes BCNF sacrifices this; 3NF can be used as an alternative.

### Normal Forms in DBMS
Used to eliminate redundancy and anomalies:

#### 1NF – No multivalued attributes.

#### 2NF – No partial dependencies (on part of a composite key).

#### 3NF – No transitive dependencies.

#### BCNF – Stronger than 3NF; every determinant must be a superkey.

#### 4NF – Removes multi-valued dependencies.

#### 5NF – Deals with join dependencies.


## --- Lesson 13 ---
### Multivalued Dependencies (MVDs)
- **Definition**: x -> Y holds if the set of Y values for a given X is independent of other attributes.
- **Example**: An instructor with multiple addresses and departments  
- **Problem**: Redundancy due to repeated addresses per department.
- **Solution**: Decompose schema into 4NF.


### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
- A relation is in **4NF** if every non-trivial MVD X -> Y implies X is a **superkey**.


### 5NF / PJNF
- Deals with **join dependencies** (generalization of MVDs).
- Eliminates more redundancy not caught in 4NF.

### Domain-Key Normal Form (DKNF)
- Even more general form; based on domain and key constraints.
- **Rare in practice** due to complexity and lack of tools.

#### Atomic Domains & First Normal Form (1NF)
- **1NF Rule**: All attribute values must be **atomic** (indivisible).
- **Avoid**:
  - Composite attributes 
  - Multi-valued attributes 
- **Solution**:
  - Use separate columns 
  - Use separate relations for repeated values


### Database Design Process
####  Design Approaches:
1. **E-R Diagram**  
   - Best practice: less need for normalization if well-designed.
2. **Single Large Schema**  
   - Normalize later using dependency analysis.
3. **Ad-Hoc Schema**  
   - Normalize iteratively.

#### Good Practices:
- Use **unique and consistent attribute names**
- Prefer **singular/plural naming consistency**
- Keep **keys listed first** in schemas
- Normalize unless performance requires denormalization.

### Modeling Temporal Data
- **Definition**: Data valid over specific time periods.
- **Technique**: Add start_date, end_date to relations.
