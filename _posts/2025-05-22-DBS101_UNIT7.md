## Transactions and ACID Properties
### What is a Transaction?
* A transaction is a collection of operations treated as a single logical unit of work.
* Begins with BEGIN and ends with COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
* Used to ensure data integrity, especially in multi-step operations like financial transfers.

### ACID Properties
#### Transactions must follow the ACID properties:
* Atomicity: All or nothing. If one operation fails, the whole transaction is undone.
* Consistency: Ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
* Isolation: Transactions operate independently without interfering with each other.
* Durability: Once committed, changes remain even if the system crashes.

### Storage Structures
#### Three types of storage used in transaction management:
* Volatile: Fast, but doesn’t survive crashes (e.g., RAM).
* Non-Volatile: Survives crashes (e.g., SSDs, HDDs).
* Stable: Theoretically never loses data (e.g., RAID with backups).

### Transaction States
* Active: Transaction is executing.
* Partially Committed: Final statement executed.
* Failed: Error occurred.
* Aborted: Rolled back.
* Committed: Successfully completed.

### Transaction Isolation and Scheduling
* Serial Schedule: One transaction runs at a time.
* Non-Serial Schedule: Transactions run concurrently.
* Serializable Schedule: Non-serial but behaves like a serial one.

### Serializability
* Ensures correct concurrent execution.
* Conflict Serializability: Use precedence graphs to test.
* A schedule with no cycle is considered conflict serializable.

### Recoverability and Cascading
* Recoverable Schedules: Don’t commit a transaction if it read data from an uncommitted transaction.
* Cascadeless Schedules: A transaction only reads data written by committed transactions.

### Isolation Levels
#### From strict to lenient:
1. Serializable
2. Repeatable Read
3. Read Committed
4. Read Uncommitted

### Implementing Isolation
* Locks: Use two-phase locking.
* Timestamps: Order by start time.
* Multi-Versioning: Use snapshot isolation (e.g., in PostgreSQL).

### Key Points:
* Transactions ensure integrity and consistency in databases.
* ACID properties define reliable transaction behavior.
* Isolation prevents conflicts during concurrent execution.
* PostgreSQL and other DBMSs use locking, timestamps, and versioning to maintain isolation.
* Serializability is critical for maintaining database correctness in concurrent environments.

## --- Lesson 19 ---
## Locks & Concurrency
* Concurrency control ensures isolation when multiple transactions execute simultaneously.
* Locks provide isolation and prevent conflicts:

    Shared Lock (S): Read-only access.

    Exclusive Lock (X): Read & write access.

* Transactions must request locks from the concurrency-control manager.

* Only one writer is allowed at a time, but multiple readers can coexist.

### Two-Phase Locking (2PL) Protocol
* Ensures serializability with two phases:

    Growing phase – Transactions can acquire locks but not release them.

    Shrinking phase – Transactions release locks but can't acquire new ones.

### Deadlocks
* Occur when transactions wait on each other forming a cycle.

#### Handling Deadlocks
1. Detection:
   * Use a waits-for graph.
   * If a cycle is found, a victim is rolled back.

2. Prevention:
   * Use timestamp-based priority (older = higher priority).
   * Wait-Die: Older waits, younger aborts.
   * Wound-Wait: Older preempts younger.

#### Rollback Strategies:
* Complete rollback.
* Partial rollback using savepoints.

### Implementation of Locks
* Managed by a lock manager using a lock table.
* Prevents starvation by granting locks in request order.
* Deadlocks still need handling.

### Lock Granularity
* Locks can be at different levels: attribute, tuple, page, table.
* Intention Locks help manage hierarchical locking:
   * IS, IX, SIX for shared/exclusive intentions.

### Lock Escalation
* DBMS may escalate fine-grained locks to coarse-grained ones to reduce overhead.

### Locking Operations
* Insert/Update/Delete operations are treated as writes under concurrency control.
* Phantom Phenomenon occurs when predicate reads conflict with new inserts—handled via predicate or index locking.

### oncurrency Control Techniques
#### Pessimistic Approaches
* Assume conflicts; prevent them proactively.
* Includes Two-Phase Locking (2PL), timestamp ordering.

#### Optimistic Approaches
* Assume few conflicts; validate at commit.
* Restart transactions if conflicts are found.

### Timestamp Ordering (TO)
* Uses timestamps to serialize transactions.
* Thomas Write Rule allows certain out-of-order writes to prevent unnecessary aborts.

### Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
* Multiple versions of data are maintained.
* Readers and writers do not block each other.
* Supports snapshot isolation and time-travel queries.

### Snapshot Isolation
* Transactions read a consistent snapshot of the database.
* Susceptible to Write Skew Anomaly.

### Advanced Concurrency Techniques
#### Weak Consistency Levels
* Degree 2 consistency, cursor stability, and optimistic control.

#### Main-Memory Databases
* Prefer coarse-grained latching or lock-free structures due to fast access.

#### Operation-Specific Concurrency
* Use operations like increment to increase concurrency rather than strict read/write.

#### Real-Time Databases
* Transactions have deadlines; control decisions based on priority.

### Key Points Summary
* Locks are essential for transaction isolation.
* Two-Phase Locking (2PL) ensures serializability but can lead to deadlocks.
* Deadlocks can be detected or prevented using timestamps.
* Lock granularity impacts performance and concurrency.

* Snapshot Isolation can lead to anomalies like Write Skew.

* Advanced techniques offer better concurrency for real-time or memory-optimized databases.

## Database Recovery
### Importance of Recovery Systems in DBMS
#### Recovery systems handle:
* System and transaction failures

* Human errors, security breaches

* Hardware upgrades, natural disasters

* Data corruption and compliance requirements

* Goal: Ensure transactions are atomic and database remains consistent.

### Log-Based Recovery
* Logs record all database update operations.
* Logs must be written before modifying the database.

Log Format:
```
<Ti, Xj, V1, V2>
```

* Ti: Transaction ID

* Xj: Data item

* V1: Old value

* V2: New value

Other log entries:
```
<Ti start, Ti commit, Ti abort>
```

* Ti start – Transaction start

* Ti commit – Transaction successfully committed

* Ti abort – Transaction rolled back

### Database Modification Techniques
* Deferred modification: Changes applied after commit.

* Immediate modification: Changes applied during transaction execution.


### Undo and Redo Operations
* Undo(Ti): Restores all changes made by Ti to their old values.
  * Writes redo-only log records during undo
  * Ends with a "Ti abort" log record

* Redo(Ti): Reapplies all changes made by Ti to ensure their effects are saved.
  * Performed using a single pass through the log

### System Crash Scenarios
* Before commit: Undo is performed.

* After commit: Redo is performed.

* During transaction: Undo incomplete, redo completed ones.

###  Checkpoints
* Record system state periodically to reduce log scanning.

* Steps:
  * Write all log records to stable storage
  * Flush modified buffers to disk
  * Write checkpoint record listing active transactions

* Fuzzy Checkpoint: Allows updates during checkpoint, reducing impact on system but complicating recovery.

### Buffering and Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
  * Log Record Buffering: Log records are temporarily stored in memory.
  * WAL Rule: Log must be written to stable storage before database changes.

#### Database Buffering Policies:
  * No-force: Commit allowed without flushing data to disk

  * Steal: Uncommitted data can be written to disk

###  Recovery from Disk Loss
* Use periodic full backups to restore database
* Apply logs created after backup for complete recovery

### High Availability with Remote Backups
* Log shipping to a remote site

* Remote site can take over on failure

* Strategies:
  * Hot-spare (logs constantly replayed)
  * Commit durability: one-safe, two-safe options

### Recovery Algorithms
#### Recovery actions include:
* Logging during normal transaction processing
* Recovery after failure

#### ARIES (used in IBM DB2):
1. Analysis Pass – Identify dirty pages and active transactions

2. Redo Pass – Repeat all changes since last checkpoint

3. Undo Pass – Rollback incomplete transactions

#### ARIES Techniques:

* WAL with STEAL + NO-FORCE

* Repeat history during redo

* Log undo actions

### Main-Memory Database Recovery
* Main memory is volatile – logs/checkpoints are essential

* Optimizations:
  * No redo logging for indexes

  * Only undo logs needed for aborts

  * Parallel recovery using multiple cores

### Key Points
* Recovery is critical to maintain atomicity, consistency, and durability in the face of failures.

* Log-based recovery tracks changes before they’re applied.

* Undo and redo operations help roll back or reapply changes.

* Checkpoints and fuzzy checkpoints reduce recovery overhead.

* WAL rule ensures changes are not lost.

* ARIES algorithm performs robust recovery using a 3-phase approach.

* Main-memory databases need optimized, fast recovery strategies.

* Remote backup systems enhance availability and disaster recovery.
