## Database Systems Study Notes
### What i learned from this unit
### Why do we need database

### --- Lesson 6 ---
#### 1. ACID Properties
ACID ensures reliable transaction processing in databases:

* Atomicity:
Transactions are "all or nothing."
If any part fails, the entire transaction rolls back.

* Consistency:
Ensures the database transitions from one valid state to another.
Constraints (e.g., foreign keys, checks) are maintained.

* Isolation:
Concurrent transactions do not interfere.
Example: Two users booking the same seat appear sequential.

* Durability:
Committed changes survive system failures (e.g., stored in non-volatile memory).

#### 2. SQL Overview

* History:
Developed by IBM in the 1970s as SEQUEL for the System R project (a prototype relational DBMS).

* Components:
DDL (Data Definition Language): Define/modify structures (e.g., CREATE TABLE).
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Query/update data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT).

* Integrity Constraints: Rules to enforce data validity (e.g., PRIMARY KEY).

* Authorization: Manage user permissions.

#### 3. SQL Data Types & Constraints
##### Common Data Types:
* CHAR(n): Fixed-length string.

* VARCHAR(n): Variable-length string.
INT, SMALLINT: Integer values.

* NUMERIC(p,s): Fixed-point decimals (e.g., NUMERIC(4,2) = 10.50).
DATE, TIMESTAMP: Date/time values.

* Key Constraints:

* PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies a row.

* FOREIGN KEY: Links tables (ensures referential integrity).
NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT.

#### 4. SQL Schema Definition
##### Key Concepts
* Primary Key: Ensures each row in a table is unique (e.g., Username in Users, Flight_no in Flight).

* Foreign Key: Links data across tables (e.g., Username in Flight connects to Users).

* Data Types: Define the kind of data stored (e.g., dates, text, numbers).

* Commands: Use SQL statements to create, modify, and retrieve data.

#### 6. Guided Exercises
* ERD to Relational Schema: Convert entities and relationships into tables with keys.

* Hands-On Practice:
Create tables for an airline system (Users, Flight, Class, Payment, Ticket).

#### Key Takeaways

* ACID Properties:
I rely on ACID properties to ensure my database transactions are reliable. Atomicity guarantees that all parts of a transaction either commit or roll back together, consistency ensures my data consistency, isolation avoids conflicts while performing operations in parallel, and durability keeps changes in effect even after system crashes.

* SQL:
I use SQL as the default language for communicating with relational databases. SQL allows me to define structures, retrieve data, impose rules, and manage transactions efficiently.

* Constraints:
I enforce data integrity through constraints like PRIMARY KEY (to ensure records are unique) and FOREIGN KEY (to maintain relationships between tables). These constraints disallow inappropriate or orphaned data.

* DDL vs. DML
I define my database schema using DDL (Data Definition Language) statements like CREATE TABLE. To modify the data, I use DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations like INSERT and SELECT.

* Real-World Practice:
I solidify my skills by practicing with real-world schemas like developing an airline ticketing system. It makes me aware of how tables, keys, and constraints work together in real life.

### --- Lesson 7 ---
#### 1. SQL as a Standard Language for RDBMS
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage relational databases.

Supports data definition (DDL), manipulation (DML), and querying.


#### Key Points to Remember
#####  ACID Properties ensure transaction reliability.

* SQL Structure: I always start with SELECT, then FROM, add WHERE for filtering, and use ORDER BY to sort results. Order matters!

* Filtering: I use WHERE to narrow down rows. Combine conditions with AND/OR, and LIKE with % or _ for patterns (e.g., WHERE name LIKE 'A%').

* Joins: I link tables using common keys like IDs. For example, FROM Users JOIN Ticket ON Users.Username = Ticket.Booked_by_user.

* Modify Tables: I add or rename columns with ALTER TABLE (e.g., ALTER TABLE Users ADD Email VARCHAR(255)).

* Wildcards: % matches any string, _ matches one character. Super handy for partial searches.

* Deletion: I use DELETE FROM Table WHERE... to remove rows and DROP TABLE/DATABASE to nuke entire structures.

* Aliasing: I rename columns or tables temporarily with AS for cleaner queries (e.g., SELECT Username AS ID).

### --- Lesson 8 ---
####  Null Values
Represent missing/unknown data.

Arithmetic/comparisons with NULL yield NULL or UNKNOWN. Use IS NULL/IS NOT NULL to check.

In logic: AND/OR with UNKNOWN can produce UNKNOWN, true, or false.

#### Aggregate Functions
AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT, SUM: Calculate summaries (ignore NULLs).

GROUP BY: Groups rows with identical values before aggregation.

HAVING: Filters groups after aggregation (vs. WHERE, which filters rows before).

#### Nested Subqueries
IN/NOT IN: Check if a value exists in a subquery result.

EXISTS/NOT EXISTS: Check if a subquery returns any rows.

ANY/ALL: Compare a value to all or any subquery results.

FROM/WITH clauses: Use subqueries to simplify complex logic or create temporary tables.

#### Database Modifications
DELETE: Remove rows matching a condition.

INSERT: Add new rows (directly or from query results).

UPDATE: Change values in existing rows.

#### Window Functions
Perform calculations across rows (e.g., rankings, running totals) without collapsing results.

PARTITION BY: Groups rows for the calculation.

ORDER BY: Sorts rows within groups.

Examples: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, AVG over a sliding window.

#### Key Takeaways

Handle NULLs carefully in comparisons and logic.

Use aggregates with GROUP BY/HAVING for summaries.

Subqueries simplify complex queries (e.g., check existence, compare sets).

Window functions enable advanced row-level calculations.
